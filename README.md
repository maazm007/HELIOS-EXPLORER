# HELIOS-EXPLORER
This is an AR/VR based project made for NASA SPACE APP CHALLENGE 2021

This project was made in a team of 4 people including me. Other team members were Ayush Kumar, Snigdha Singh, Anupam Tiwari.

We have used the tools like Unity and C# Scripting Programming Language and few uses of Audio Mixer Software.

This project was made in just 5 days so there is large scope of improvement.

If anyone desires to help and contribute in the project for better user experience, he/she is welcomed anytime by us!
